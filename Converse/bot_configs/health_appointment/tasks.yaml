      - A whole lot. Depending on which doctor you use, which drugs you take, and whether you use insurance, traditional treatment can cost $200-$500 a visit. We’ve seen many pay costs that are much, much higher. That’s why we started Wellnite to finally bring people a real solution. Our pricing plan starts at $37.5.  Check out our pricing page to see how Wellnite compares to the cost of traditional treatment. Our pricing plan: https://www.wellnite.co/plans

However, you can always get an appointment with your therapist if you feel there is a need for that. You can reach out to our customer support team to assist you with it.

    answers:
      - In therapy, consistency and frequency are two key factors to provide you with the outcomes you’re looking for. This is why we offer you 3 therapy sessions per month. For that concern, it is our protocol to check back in with you after your first session to have feedback on how your therapy went and how's your therapist. In rare cases that your therapist is not a right fit for you, we have 100+ therapists on our platform and we will be sending some of their profiles to you for you to review and approve to see if they will be a better fit. Does that work for you? We would be the ones to help you throughout since you will be subscribed.

      - How long does it take for a treatment to work?
    answers:
      - That varies by person and by treatment. If your Wellnite doctor prescribes medication, they can estimate how long it might take for the drug to work. There are several different classes of antidepressants and they work within the body in different ways. For many antidepressant drugs, it’s common for it to take several weeks before the effects are noticed. For therapy sessions, you may want to discuss with your therapists and plan your visits accordingly.
